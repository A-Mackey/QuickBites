## Get Started
#### Must Have
##### Node Package Manager
##### IDE of choice
#### To Get Website Running
You must have 2 terminals to run all the features of this website.
First `npm install --save` to get dependencies installed (This will take a minute)
```
npm run serve
npm run dev
```
These two commands must be run in seperate terminals at the same time. This will launch the website at http://localhost:8080/?#/ and an API on port 9078.
From there, you can use the website to its full potential.
